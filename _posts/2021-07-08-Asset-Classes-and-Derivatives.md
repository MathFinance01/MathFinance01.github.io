<h4> Introduction </h4>

If you look at any financial institution with a trading desk, you will see that the desk is further divided into 3-4 smaller trading desks. Each of these desks trade in an asset class. For example, the 4 trading desks can be FX, equities, commodities and fixed income. There can be other trading desks such as Crypto Currency trading desk. And that completely depends on the institution's interest and expertise.

Why do we need to separate trading desks according to asset classes?
The answer is easy to guess. Manageing the desk becomes a lot easier if it is divided according to asset classes. Here is a definition of asset classes from Investopedia.

"An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Asset classes are made up of instruments which often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace."

Although there is no hard-and-fast rule to categorize a product into any particular asset class, all the products in an asset class are expected to behave similarly. The correlation between different asset classes is expected to be close to zero but there can be positive or negative correlation between asset classes(for ex. equities and rates or equities and Gold).


<h4>What is the need for derivatives?</h4>

Derivatives "derive" their price from an underlying. It can be a stock or a bond or hundreds of other things that have value. There can even be a derivative on a derivative(for example, call option on a call option). Derivatives are financial instruments that are generally used by investors for hedging. I have used the term "generally" here since it is up to the investor if he wants to buy an instrument for hedging or for purely speculative purpose.

If the investor is buying a derivative for hedging purposes, the derivative can be thought of as an insurace. A quick example might help.

<h5> A Farmer and A Consumer </h5>
Consider a world where there are only 2 kinds of people. One being a farmer and the other is a consumer. There is this particular farmer who knows that he will be able to grow $$X$$ amount of rice this season. But, he is worried that he might not be able to sell his rice at a good enough price. One of the ways he can ensure that he will get a good enough price at the end of the season is to make a deal with someone(can be a consumer) who is worried that the price of fresh rice might sore at end of the season. So, through this deal both of them can keep their worries away for the rest of the season.

The above example is showing the impact of a future/forward contract. The seller of the contract(farmer) and buyer of the contract(consumer) is said to be getting into a future/forward contract. Although the above example is a simple case of farmer trying to get a good enough price for his produce, derivatives such as forwards/futures can be seen almost everywhere. Just replace "price of the rice" with interest rate charged on a loan or the foreign exchange rate for a firm doing business in another country. The list goes on. 

In the above example the farmer is selling a forward/futures contract because he will be ready with his produce to sell at the end of season. But there is no requirement that the person selling the produce should be the person selling the contract. Imagine a person who is a consumer but believes that the price  everyone is expecting at the end of season is ridiculously high. He/She can go ahead and make a deal with another consumer to buy rice at the high price. Now, this person can buy the rice in the open market(also known as spot market) at the end of season and sell the rice to the consumer at the high price. If the view held by him turns out to be true, he has made a profit or otherwise he will be down with a loss.

The above example shows that derivatives can be used for speculative purposes as well.

An easy way to understand derivatives is to look for a scenario where it will be helpful(like the one in the above example).
