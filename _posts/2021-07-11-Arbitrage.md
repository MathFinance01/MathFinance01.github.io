You must have heard various definitions for arbitrage in an introductory quantitative finance texts. It goes something like this,

"There is an arbitrage in the market if there is a non zero probability of making a profit with zero investment"

Why is arbitrage(or no arbitrage rule) so important?

What actually happens in real world?

To what extent is "no arbitrage" assumption applicable?
