"arbitrage keep the markets honest. They bring perfection to imperfect markets as their hunger for free lunches prompts them to bid away the discrepancies  that attract them to the lunch counter. In the process, they make certain that prices for the same assets in different markets will be identical."
- Peter L Bernstein

You must have heard various definitions for arbitrage in an introductory quantitative finance texts. It goes something like this,

"There is an arbitrage in the market if there is a non-zero probability of making a profit with zero investment"

Why is arbitrage(or no arbitrage rule) so important?

What actually happens in real world?

To what extent is "no arbitrage" assumption applicable?
