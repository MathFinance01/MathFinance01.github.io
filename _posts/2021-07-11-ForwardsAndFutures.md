<h4> Introduction </h4>
In an earlier post we saw a bit of an introduction to forward/futures and a way they can be used to secure future cashflows. In this post we will be diving into the world of forwards and futures in a bit more detail.

Forwards and Futures are very similar but they are not the same. Following is a table of differences between Forwards and Futures.
